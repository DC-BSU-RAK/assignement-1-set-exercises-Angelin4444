    <h1 class="text"> Vintage Aloo Paratha </h1>    <!-- Giving my main heading H2 tag. I have also added a class which will help the text have some styling(All the styles done using CSS is in the stylesheet file.)-->
    
    <p>My grandmother's homemade aloo paratha has a special vintage charm and magic to it. The love she puts into making it makes the flavor rise to a different dimension altogether. Aloo paratha is essentially a delicious flatbread stuffed with spiced, mashed potatoes. The tender, spicy filling and the crispy, golden paratha layers make it absolutely delightful. Every bite carries the warmth, nostalgia, and the sense of homemade food in it. Let's get into one of my favorite dishes, one that's been handed down through generations and mastered by my grandmother. Her aloo paratha is more than a meal—it's a taste of tradition and love.</p> <!-- This is a paragrah tag normally used for longs sentences and paragrahs. -->
