    <h1 class="vintage-text"> Vintage Aloo Paratha </h1>
    <p>My grandmother's homemade aloo paratha has a special vintage charm and magic to it. The love she puts into making it makes the flavor rise to a different dimension altogether. Aloo paratha is essentially a delicious flatbread stuffed with spiced, mashed potatoes. The tender, spicy filling and the crispy, golden paratha layers make it absolutely delightful. Every bite carries the warmth, nostalgia, and the sense of homemade food in it. Let's get into one of my favorite dishes, one that's been handed down through generations and mastered by my grandmother. Her aloo paratha is more than a meal—it's a taste of tradition and love.</p>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Make the dough:</h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the filling:</h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mash the boiled potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt to the mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix well and then add chopped cilantro, green chilies, and grated ginger (if using). Adjust seasoning to your taste.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Shape and Stuff the Parathas:</h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li>After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball).</li>
        <li>Roll one dough ball into a small, thick circle using some dry flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Place a generous spoonful of the potato filling in the center.</li>
        <li>Carefully bring the edges of the dough together to seal the filling inside.</li>
        <li>Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a flat, round paratha (don’t roll too thin).</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Cook the Parathas:</h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat a tawa or flat pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place the paratha on the hot tawa and cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side until it starts to puff up.</li>
        <li>Flip it over and cook the other side.</li>
        <li>Brush some ghee or oil on both sides and cook until golden and crispy. You should see small brown spots on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
        <ol>
        <li>Serve your hot Aloo Paratha with yogurt, pickle, or a dollop of butter.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
